		<h1>**Computers - Are We Better Off With or Without Them?**</h1>
		<p>In todayâ€™s technologically advanced and digitized world, it is easy to overlook just how many aspects of our lives that computers play a part in.  Computers are everywhere and in everything!  They are in our smartphones and cars.  They control our microwaves and coffee makers.  Without an unseen computer, doing what it is programmed to do inside our devices and appliances, many of the mundane, everyday tasks that we take for granted would become difficult or nearly impossible.  Along with making everyday life easier, there are innumerous benefits that computers have wrought upon the world, including medical and agricultural advancements along with an increase in cognitive ability and the emotional state of individuals.  With and without their awareness, these benefits touch billions of people around the world each and every day.  On the flip side of the same coin, there are the negative aspects of what computers have brought to our planet.  There is widespread scamming and identity theft.  There are children being bullied on social media and a wide range of medical conditions that have been linked back to the use of specific technologies.  As this article moves forward, we will delve into some of the positives and negatives; allowing the reader to make their own decision on the simple, but everlasting question; Are we better off with or without computers? </p>
