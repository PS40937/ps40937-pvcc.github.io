		<h1>**Computers - Are We Better Off With or Without Them?**</h1>
						<img src="Computer1.jpg" Height=250 Width=250 />  
		<p>In todayâ€™s technologically advanced and digitized world, it is easy to overlook just how many aspects of our lives that computers play a part in.  Computers are everywhere and in everything!  They are in our smartphones and cars.  They control our microwaves and coffee makers.  Without an unseen computer, doing what it is programmed to do inside our devices and appliances, many of the mundane, everyday tasks that we take for granted would become difficult or nearly impossible.  Along with making everyday life easier, there are innumerous benefits that computers have wrought upon the world, including medical and agricultural advancements along with an increase in cognitive ability and the emotional state of individuals.  With and without their awareness, these benefits touch billions of people around the world each and every day.  On the flip side of the same coin, there are the negative aspects of what computers have brought to our planet.  There is widespread scamming and identity theft.  There are children being bullied on social media and a wide range of medical conditions that have been linked back to the use of specific technologies.  As this article moves forward, we will delve into some of the positives and negatives; allowing the reader to make their own decision on the simple, but everlasting question; Are we better off with or without computers? </p>
		<p>Positives:</p>
		<br>
		<p>Nearly everything in our modern lives that is taken for granted has been derived from the development and evolution of computers.</p>
		<p>Everythng from our cell phones to our cars, from our homes to our hospitals. </p>
		<p> Imagine if you will, a world without cell phones.  Simply planning a family road trip could take exponentially longer than it does with a cell phone.  In today's world, we can just type in the address of our destination into a range of different GPS (Global Positioning System) apps and off we go.  Without this technology, we would be stuck looking at maps and atlases, making note of each turn and intersection.  After all of this planning, you could be stuck having to find a new route due to construction or some other obstacle that GPS would have been aware of and routed around but a map is nothing more than a picture on a piece of paper.</p>
		<p>The number of medical advnacements that have been made over the past 60 years has had a dramatic effect on the life expectancy of the average American which has increased from 69.7 years in 1960 to 79.4 years in 2015.  From here, the rate of increase is expected to continue, reaching as high as 85.6 years old by 2060 (Medina, et. al 2020).</p>

		<p>Negatives:</p>
		<br>
		<p>As there are a wide range of positives that have been reaped through the evolution and implementation of computers, there are negative aspects to consider as well.  This modern world has brought the world to our fingertips, literally.  With that comes the consequences such as accelerated degeneration of vision, carpal tunnel syndrome and an medium through which people can hurl insults, often times without fear of repurcussion.  Just as there are innumerous benefits that have been gained thanks to the "Computer Age", there are a great many negatives as well.  The list could be expanded upon almost to to infinity but lets start with these few aspects.</p>
		<p>	**Social and Behavioral Impacts**</p>
			<p>"Social media and Cyberbullying: Increased social media use correlates with higher risks of cyberbullyinh, mental health issues, and social isolation, especiallyamong young females."</p>	
		<p>"Social Support: Heavy internet use leads to reduced social support and diminished face-to-face interactions, increasing loneliness and contributing to mental health struggles."
