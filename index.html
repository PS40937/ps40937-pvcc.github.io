		<h1>**Computers - Are We Better Off With or Without Them?**</h1>
						<img src="Computer1.jpg" Height=250 Width=250 />  
		<p>In todayâ€™s technologically advanced and digitized world, it is easy to overlook just how many aspects of our lives that computers play a part in.  Computers are everywhere and in everything!  They are in our smartphones and cars.  They control our microwaves and coffee makers.  Without an unseen computer, doing what it is programmed to do inside our devices and appliances, many of the mundane, everyday tasks that we take for granted would become difficult or nearly impossible.  Along with making everyday life easier, there are innumerous benefits that computers have wrought upon the world, including medical and agricultural advancements along with an increase in cognitive ability and the emotional state of individuals.  With and without their awareness, these benefits touch billions of people around the world each and every day.  On the flip side of the same coin, there are the negative aspects of what computers have brought to our planet.  There is widespread scamming and identity theft.  There are children being bullied on social media and a wide range of medical conditions that have been linked back to the use of specific technologies.  As this article moves forward, we will delve into some of the positives and negatives; allowing the reader to make their own decision on the simple, but everlasting question; Are we better off with or without computers? </p>
		<p>Positives:</p>
		<p>Nearly everything in our modern lives that is taken for granted has been derived from the development and evolution of computers.</p>
		<p>Everythng from our cell phones to our cars, from our homes to our hospitals. </p>
		<p> Imagine if you will, a world without cell phones.  Simply planning a family road trip could take exponentially longer than it does with a cell phone.  In today's world, we can just type in the address of our destination into a range of different GPS (Global Positioning System) apps and off we go.  Without this technology, we would be stuck looking at maps and atlases, making note of each turn and intersection.  After all of this planning, you could be stuck having to find a new route due to construction or some other obstacle that GPS would have been aware of and routed around but a map is nothing more than a picture on a piece of paper.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The number of medical advnacements that have been made over the past 60 years has had a dramatic effect on the life expectancy of the average American which has increased from 69.7 years in 1960 to 79.4 years in 2015.  From here, the rate of increase is expected to continue, reaching as high as 85.6 years old by 2060 (Medina, et. al 2020).</p>
		<br>
		<p> Taking this in another direction, studies have found connections between playing video games and positive aspects to one's health both mentally and physically. "Video game training augments gray matter in areas of the brain that relate to cognitive abilities related to sparial navigation, strategic planning, and working memory"(Haddock, et. al. 2022).</p>

		<p>Negatives:</p>
		<p>Just as there are innumerous benefits that have been gained thanks to the "Computer Age", there are a great many negatives as well.  This modern world has brought the world and all of the information it contains, to our fingertips, literally.  With that comes consequences such as sleep disruption, a medium through which people can hurl insults, often times without fear of repurcussion and a wide range of physical ailments.  The list could be expanded upon almost to infinity but lets start with these few aspects.</p>
		<p>	**Social and Behavioral Impacts**</p>
			<p>"Social media and Cyberbullying: Increased social media use correlates with higher risks of cyberbullying, mental health issues, and social isolation, especially among young females(Challa 2024)."</p>	
			<p>"Social Support: Heavy internet use leads to reduced social support and diminished face-to-face interactions, increasing loneliness and contributing to mental health struggles(Challa 2024)."
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>Sleep Disruption</p>
			<li><p>It has been found that screen time, quite often while sedentary, replaces what would have been physical activity time, which, in turn, has a negative impact on sleep quality.</p></li>
			<li><p>Screens emit blue light which can interfer with the production of melatonin which then has an impact on the person's circadian rhythms.</p></li>
			<li><p>The use of Social Media at night, speecifically when interacting with emotional posts, can lead to delayed bedtimes resulting in inadequate sleep and feeling under-rested the follwing day.</p></li>
			<br>
			<br>
		<p>As we have seen, these are just a very select few of both the positives and negatives that computers have brought to our society, species and world.  Do the advnacements in the medical field outweigh the emotional trauma endured by today's youth through online trolling and bullying?  Do increased cognitive abilities from video game training exceed the result of a consistent lack of sleep?
